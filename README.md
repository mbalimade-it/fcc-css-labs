# FreeCodeCamp CSS Lab Projects

This repository contains all my CSS labs from the FreeCodeCamp Full Stack Developer curriculum.

## Overview

Labs are not guided exercises. I am given a project example, and then I must meet the code requirements to show that I have applied what I previously learned from the lectures and workshops. Each lab focuses on a specific set of skills.

## How to Use

- Each folder contains the full code for that lab.
- Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the result.
- Screenshots are provided to show what I learned in each lab.
